# Traffic Taxi Optimization in Beijing

> Optimizing taxi routes and traffic visualization in Beijing using data analysis, A* pathfinding, and web deployment.

## About the Project

This project focuses on optimizing taxi traffic in Beijing by analyzing real-world taxi data, implementing optimal routing algorithms, and creating an interactive web application.

Main achievements:

- **Implemented the A* algorithm** to find the most efficient routes between locations.
- **Visualized traffic density** through heat maps and clustering techniques.
- **Developed and deployed a web application** using **Streamlit** to interactively display results and simulations.
